# Carbon-emission-prediction
This is the code for a carbon emission prediction model. The code can directly read TIFF images and train a model between X (land use in 2015, GDP in 2015, carbon emissions in 2015, population in 2015) and Y (carbon emissions in 2020).
The aim is to use landuse, GDP, carbon emissions, and population data from the current year to predict carbon emissions five years later.
